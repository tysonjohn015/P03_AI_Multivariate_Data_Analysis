# Multivariate Data Analysis
:dart: The goal of this project is to perform multivariate data analysis (incl. exploration, cleaning and visualisation), to help the agents of a Public Health Agency to identify relevant insights from *cleaned* Open Food Facts dataset.

# Dataset

[Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) dataset, *made by everyone, for everyone*.

# Criteria for qualifying healthy food 
:green_salad: Is a green salad always healthy ?

To demonstrate nutritional quality of a specific food, the Public Health Agency has created an indicator: the Nutri Score.

From my opinion, a quality diet contains foods with little salt or sugar, less fat, perhaps organic, as few additives as possible, and maybe without palm oil.

Thus, I've added my personal scoring to be able to compare the foods.

We will try to explore the dataset with these criteria in mind.
